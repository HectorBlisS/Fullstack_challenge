## Fullstack Challenge

I decided to use **Remix**, because I have both sides of the app (backend, frontend) in the same project and even the same file.

I used **MongoDB** as a cloud database. At the beginning, I wanted to use **SQLite**, but I wanted to deploy it, so a cloud DB was needed.

## Features

- You can list all the tasks

- You can filter'em by assignee

- You can select a second filter to download by today, tomorrow or next week

- You can download CSV or open the JSON URL.

## Missing time ðŸ«¥

I'd like to change my approach a bit, by using URL as state, because I experimented a bit with the JSON route and regret some pattern decisions, but I had a lack of time. ðŸ¥² Even tho, I feel good about what I came up with.
